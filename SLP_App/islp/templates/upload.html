  <h2>Please read the following passage:</h2>
  <p>You wish to know all about my
  grandfather. Well, he is nearly 93
  years old, yet he still thinks as swiftly
  as ever. He dresses himself in an old
  black frock coat, usually several
  buttons missing. A long beard clings
  to his chin, giving those who observe
  him a pronounced feeling of the
  utmost respect. When he speaks, his
  voice is just a bit cracked and quivers
  a bit. Twice each day he plays
  skillfully and with zest upon a small
  organ. Except in the winter when the
  snow or ice prevents, he slowly takes
  a short walk in the open air each day.
  We have often urged him to walk more
  and smoke less, but he always
  answers, “Banana oil!” Grandfather
  likes to be modern in his language.</p>
